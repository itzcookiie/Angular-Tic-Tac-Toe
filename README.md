# AngularProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Challenging

`Total time spent: around 4hrs`

Initially, I tried to create the required views, but decided to stop and plan. I realised it would be best to start from the AWS API and get that going. I saw the AWS API as the core functionality, with the plan that once I got that done, all I needed to do was fill in the rest e.g. creating the UI to display the relevant data.

Unfortunately, I was not able to get the AWS API to work properly. I struggled to configure the settings and found myself going back and forth, spending more or less the entire time trying to fix this. 

## Design decisions

I used the most basic design possible in order to work on the functionality as quickly as possible, which led me to creating a login/signup page in the same window. I wanted to make sure the data flow works and it is set up architectually correct at least from the API/back-end side.

I attempted to use the AWS JavaScript SDK, as it looked the most relevant and effective tool for the job.

## More time

If I had more time, I would spend more time trying to get the AWS API to work. Once I get that up and running, I would be able to just add in the extra bits e.g. other views.
